This template is used to develop Telegram bots using the Aiogram V3.0+ Library.

## SQLAlchemy + Alembic
The code includes examples of a User table using SQLAlchemy 2.0, and scripts for Alembic (Alembic initialization, creating and applying migrations).

However, if you have never worked with these tools before, please refer to the documentation and learn about them. Also, I offer an English [course on these tools at Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/sqlalchemy-alembic-bootcamp/?referralCode=E9099C5B5109EB747126).

### To start using:
1. Copy `.env.dist` to `.env` and fill in the necessary data.
2. Create new handlers.
3. **With Docker:**
   1. You can immediately start the project with Docker, and if you don't have it, [download and install it](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
   2. Start the project with the command `docker-compose up`.
4. **Without Docker:**
   1. Create a [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).
   2. Install dependencies from requirements.txt: `pip install -r requirements.txt --pre`.
   3. Start the project with the command `python3 bot.py`.

### How to create and register handlers:
Create a module `you_name.py` in the `handlers` folder.

Create a router in `you_name.py`.
```python
from aiogram import Router
user_router = Router()
```
Multiple routers can be made in one module, and handlers can be attached to each.
Handlers can be registered using decorators:

python

@user_router.message(commands=["start"])
async def user_start(message):
    await message.reply("Welcome, regular user!")

Enter the file handlers/__init__.py and add all routers to it:

python

from .admin import admin_router
from .echo import echo_router
from .user import user_router

...

routers_list = [
    admin_router,
    user_router,
    echo_router,  # echo_router must be last
]

How to add handlers to our bot:

Go to the file bot.py and unpack our handlers:

python

from tgbot.handlers import routers_list

...

async def main():
   
...

   dp.include_routers(*routers_list)

...

How to start the Database and conduct your first migration:

    Go to the .env file and fill in the database details if you have not done so earlier.

    Go to the file docker-compose.yml and uncomment sections: api, pg_database, and volumes to begin work.

    Go to config.py and complete the TODO in the function construct_sqlalchemy_url. Also, find the section of the function load_config and uncomment the line that corresponds to the database configuration initialization db=DbConfig.from_env(env) to activate the database connection.

    Now we can restart Docker with new containers using the command:

    docker-compose up --build.

    All set! Now we can conduct the migration!
    Open the terminal and enter the following command:

    docker-compose exec api alembic upgrade head
